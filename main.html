    Thomas Alva Edison (February 11, 1847 â€“ October 18, 1931) was an American inventor and businessman who has been described as America's greatest inventor. He developed many devices in fields such as electric power generation, mass communication, sound recording, and motion pictures. He Has invented Bulb. In the Period from 1878 to 1889 Edison and his associates worked on atleast three thousand different theories todevelop an efficient incandescent Lamp.By January 1879, at his laboratory in Menlo Park, New Jersey, Edison had built his first high resistance, incandescent electric light. It worked by passing electricity through a thin platinum filament in the glass vacuum bulb, which delayed the filament from melting. Still, the lamp only burned for a few short hours. Edison and his team made a new vacuum pump to make better vacuums in glass light bulbs.  It was better known as the "glow bulb."  Thomas' second attempt at the glow bulb successfully lit for forty hours.  On New Year's Eve Edison lit up Menlno.
Park with thirty glow bulbs.  Electricity would replace gas for lighting purposes.  The light bulb gives off light so that we can see with out lanterns and candles.  The Edison Lamp Company produced 1,000 lightbulbs a day.
